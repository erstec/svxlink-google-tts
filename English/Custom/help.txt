This is the S v x Link repeater system help.
S v x Link repeaters are controlled by DTMF commands consisting of one or more digits followed buy a number sign.
The system is divided into several modules,each performing a specific task. 
You activate a module by sending its module ID followed buy a number sign.
Most modules will play their help message if a 0 is sent while the module is active.
In addition there are a number of built-in commands not associated with modules
that return information about the repeater.  Contact the system owner for a list.
Sending a single star will make the system identify itself.
