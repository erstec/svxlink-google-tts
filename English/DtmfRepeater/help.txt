The DTMF repeater module is used to retransmit received DTMF digits. 
This can be used to control other remote stations that are also DTMF controlled. 
All received DTMF digits will be retransmitted and ignored completely by S v x Link. 
Deactivate the module by sending the number sign for at least three seconds.
